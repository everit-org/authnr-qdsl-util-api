   * @param actions

   *          resource record (directly or by inheritance), the result will provide
   *          <code>true</code>.
   * @return An expression that can be used as a predicate in the main query.
   * @throws NullPointerException
   *           if the targetResourceId parameter is null, the actions parameter is null or the
   *           actions array contains null value.
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException
   *           if the actions parameter is a zero length array.
